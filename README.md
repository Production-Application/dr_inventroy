### Dr. Inventory
Inventory Management is one of the basic problems in almost every
company. Before computer age and integration, paper tables and paperwork solutions
were being used as inventory management tools. These we very far from being
a solution, took so much time, even needed employees just for this section of
organization. There was no an efficient solution available in the many companies
during these days. Every process was based on paperwork, human fault rate was
high, the process and the tracing the inventory losses were not possible, and there
was no efficient logging systems. After the computer age, every process is started to
be integrated into electronic environment. And now we have qualified technology
to implement new solutions to these problems. Software based systems bring the
